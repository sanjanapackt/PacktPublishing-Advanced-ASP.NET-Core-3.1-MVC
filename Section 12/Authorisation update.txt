Authorization Update
Microsoft has changed few things with Identity vs DefaultIdentity which we updated in startup.cs a while ago.

Because of which the default paths to login/logout and access denied fails.

If in the next video you face this error all you have to do is add the following cookies to set the paths as explained below.



Insisde Startup.cs -> ConfigureServices

Add the following code at end.

services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>

{

          options.LoginPath = $"/Identity/Account/Login";

          options.LogoutPath = $"/Identity/Account/Logout";

          options.AccessDeniedPath = $"/Identity/Account/AccessDenied";

});

They have explained it here-
